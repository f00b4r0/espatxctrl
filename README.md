## Features

The software implements a simple telnet interface accessible on standard port 23:
- Asks for (cleartext) password (to prevent accidental access) 
- Offers a set of commands for toggling/reading GPIO connected to **ATXctrl** (type `help` for details)
- Provides full serial console passthrough over telnet session (command `console`)

## Building

### Configure the project

Possibly adjust the default "password" string ("admin") in `main/cmdparse.l` (look for `/* password */`), then run:

`idf.py reconfigure`

Note: you may want to adjust the hostname under the lwIP component.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board:

`idf.py flash`

See the ESP-idf Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
