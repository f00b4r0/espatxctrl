# espatxctrl

Host control software for [ATXctrl](http://hacks.slashdirt.org/hw/atxctrl/), ESP-idf implementation.

Supports the [WT32-ETH01](http://www.wireless-tag.com/portfolio/wt32-eth01/) ESP32 module by default,
should work fine with any ESP32 module.

## Features

The software implements a simple telnet interface accessible on standard port 23
(basic networking implemented through [simple_network](http://vcs.slashdirt.org/git/sw/ESP/simple_network.git)):

- Asks for (cleartext) password (to prevent accidental access) 
- Offers a set of commands for toggling/reading GPIO connected to **ATXctrl**
- Allows setting console baudrate and saving it to non-volatile storage
- Provides full serial console passthrough over telnet session
- Provides a basic push OTA firmware update system, rollback-compatible, through [simple_pushota](http://vcs.slashdirt.org/git/sw/ESP/simple_pushota.git)

### Full list of commands:

```
baudrate <value> set
baudrate {get|save}
firmware {get|set|save|quit}
{ledhdd|ledpower} get
{power|reset} [long] press
console
help
quit
```

Commands are self-explanatory, possibly needing explanation: `firmware set` triggers the push OTA update system,
`firmware save` marks the newly booted firmware as valid and prevents rollback, `firwmare quit` requests rollback and reboots.

To push a new firmware to the device once the push OTA system is started, use e.g.:

`curl <esphost>:<OTA_PORT> --data-binary @build/espatxctrl.bin`

## Building

### Configure the project

Possibly adjust the default "password" string ("admin") in `main/cmdparse.l` (look for `/* password */`),
and confirm that the ports and baudrate defined in `platform.h` suits you, then run:

`idf.py reconfigure`

Note: you may want to adjust the hostname under the lwIP component.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board:

`idf.py flash`

See the ESP-idf Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
